FORM -> in jsp -->


employeeRegistraion.jsp  -->

and return that data to employeeList.jsp file....


	you can store Data in request object using reqest.setAttribute("alias name","value...")
	to dispatch from controller to jsp you can use request.getRequestDispatcher("your jsp page name").forword("request","response")


	we can print Data employeeList.jsp -->


		you can have data which is in request obejct
		you can use request.getAttribute("alias name")
		and you can store data to your data type...
		as request.getAttribute("alias name") method's return type is object you need to cast to your data type
